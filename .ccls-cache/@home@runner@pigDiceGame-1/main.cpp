Tony, Do you know how to play the pig game? (y/n)
n
This pig dice game allows the player to roll a 6 sided die against the CPU

You will have 3 options when it is your turn:
1. ROLL
2. HOLD
3. QUIT

If you ROLL a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 on the die, those cooresponding numbers are added as points to your turn points

if you ROLL a 1, you will lose your turn points for the turn and the CPU will begin their turn
At any point during your turn, you may HOLD.
A HOLD will add all of your turn points to your total score

The first player to 100 points wins.
